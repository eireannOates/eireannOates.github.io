  <h1> what is a volcano </h1>
</head>

<body>
  <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava,
     volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.</p>

  <h2> Why do Volcanoes Occur ? </h2>
</head>

<body>
<p>Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that
  float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found
  where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. Volcanoes can also
  form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift and the
  Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field.</p>
